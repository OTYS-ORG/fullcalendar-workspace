FOR beta.1
  test for ALL views
    redo cell borders
      we have major/minor mixed up
      should we always assume solid border style?
      TEST: with horizontal scrolling (dayMinWidth),
        header doesn't have top border
      theming
        i can write table-inspired css utils however i want, with borders
      resource-timeline: there's a double-border at bottom of datagrid
      resource-grouping.html
        in datagrid-area, missing bottom-border on group "564 Pacific"
      anytime pseudo-row/cells fabricate borders, need to be aware of removing last-child border
    stop doing "frame" elements for measurements, and instead use just "cushion"
      how would that work for getting a scroller's "clientWidth/clientHeight"?
    is text-selection disabled everywhere? was it before? (if fixed, find ticket)
    test inverse-bg events (like businessHours) and ensure `instance.instanceId` doesn't error
    weekNumbers (esp TimeGrid)
    ensure print-mode disables all scrolling at least (stop using isHeightAuto directly)
    RTL
  daygrid
    in "timeline-column-grouping.html" example, go to "month" view, hover over "event 3"
      and horizontal scrollbars appear quickly
    businessHours in month view, right side, has weird 1px gap
  timegrid
    near end, checkout hscroll, expandRows, slots are aligning
    make sure the cushions within the axis can have whatever width they want; parent doesn't crush them
  react/vue/angular connectors
    pause size-handling until all slots are rendered

ensure automated tests for...
  positioning of sticky headers in all views. list view sticky subheaders too
  resource-timeline indent works

AFTER beta.1
  restore print-mode
  implement ResizeObserver fallback
  just like scrollbar dead area should have grey bg, make timegrid bottom area w/o slots a grey bg
  slatline alignment bugs
    in daygrid (esp with sticky header, or horizontal scrolling?)
    timeline: with header cells when header cells are half as frequent
      (recreated in resource timeline.. in regular timeline too?)
  initial-scroll for views with complex rendering is wrong
    multiweek (uses DayGridLayout/dayGridYear-view), (and multimonth too?)
  daygrid
    for event rendering, expose an isStandin flag for if hidden behind multiday
    multiweek bug: drag-n-drop resets scroll
  timegrid
    use pixel positioning for events (to avoid TimeGridCol height hack)
    in TimeGridLayoutNormal, not nice how axis text isn't selectable
      (related to how now-indicator is rendered in axis)
  timeline
    previously, Timeline's hit system would always return slat left/right, not snap. matters?
  resource-timeline
    when few resources, and lots of space below, spreadsheet column lines should span entire height (currently doesn't)
    needed?- ability to freeze resizing while resizing columns or resource-area
    get grouping via row and col simultaneously working. should be possible. see timeline-row-n-col-grouping-not-working.html
    for syncing heights, is row-height off-by-one because inner heights don't include border?
    when DnD fits multiple tiers of events on one resource and expands height, there's a flicker
      TODO: prevent multiple passes of height-watching?
    change how column-resizing widths is distibuted?
      right now it's impossible to resize last column
      try to take width away from next column when expanding
  list-view
    for left-and-right, don't use floating, use flexbox
  hit-system
    only query DOM element for handlers like dayClick at very end
  web-component
    remove `shadow` attribute
  dev cleanliness
    remove unused css mixins
  revisit these tickets
    "Maximum update depth exceeded" error after resizing many times in Chrome --- reemerged?
      https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/issues/5606
  optimizations
    this.detachInnerHeight() // should fire a 'null' height? yes! will cleanup any map listeners
  write tests
    percentage-based resource-timeline spreadsheet-column resizing
    that expandRows works enabled/disabled for timegrid/resource-timeline views

CHANGELOG
  temporary
    the space to accommodate scrollbars is just blank
  daygrid
    how height:'auto' isn't as squished... will always try to maintain at least aspectRatio
  exports
    DayTable no longer exposed from '@fullcalendar/daygrid/internal'
    DayGridView ('@fullcalendar/daygrid/internal') renamed to DayGridView
    DayTimeCols no longer exposed from '@fullcalendar/timegrid/internal'
    DayTimeColsView ('@fullcalendar/timegrid/internal') renamed to TimeGridView
  events & a11y
    Now each event element has stable position in time based on start-date
      in effect: strictOrder affects positioning but does not affect DOM order
  minimum browser support
    supports ?? operator -- we do this a bunch now
  updateSize deprecation
    and windowResize event is no longer fired
  tickets
    unnecessary scrollbars
      https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/issues/6047
    ticket where timegrid time-axis isn't selectable
    fix those 2 incorrect date-yielding results
    make ticket where resource-timline super-header stays fixed during horizontal scrolling of datagrid
