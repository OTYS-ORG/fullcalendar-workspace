FOR beta.1
  test for ALL views
    redo cell borders
      we have major/minor mixed up
      should we always assume solid border style?
      TEST: with horizontal scrolling (dayMinWidth),
        header doesn't have top border
      theming
        i can write table-inspired css utils however i want, with borders
      resource-timeline: there's a double-border at bottom of datagrid
      rethink fcnew-cell-fixedwidth or whatever
    RTL
    stop doing "frame" elements for measurements, and instead use just "cushion"
      how would that work for getting a scroller's "clientWidth/clientHeight"?
  daygrid
    in "timeline-column-grouping.html" example, go to "month" view, hover over "event 3"
      and horizontal scrollbars appear quickly
  timegrid
    in TimeGridLayoutNormal, not nice how axis text isn't selectable
      (related to how now-indicator is rendered in axis)
  resource-timeline
    column resizing is broken
    resource-group heights aren't syncing (see resource-grouping.html)
    turn off expandRows by default
      to test, collaps groups in resource-grouping.html
    test row-grouping WITH column-grouping
    test business hours per resource VS whole
    test rows expanding to fill height (but not groups)
      ensure no awkward behavior when contracting parent-resources
    align expander/indent icons with flexbox
  react/vue/angular connectors
    pause size-handling until all slots are rendered

ensure automated tests for...
  positioning of sticky headers in all views. list view sticky subheaders too
  resource-timeline indent works

AFTER beta.1
  restore print-mode
  implement ResizeObserver fallback
  slatline alignment bugs
    in daygrid (esp with sticky header, or horizontal scrolling?)
    timeline: with header cells when header cells are half as frequent
      (recreated in resource timeline.. in regular timeline too?)
  initial-scroll for views with complex rendering is wrong
    multiweek (uses DayGridLayout/dayGridYear-view), (and multimonth too?)
  daygrid
    for event rendering, expose an isStandin flag for if hidden behind multiday
    multiweek bug: drag-n-drop resets scroll
  timeline
    previously, Timeline's hit system would always return slat left/right, not snap. matters?
  resource-timeline
    needed?- ability to freeze resizing while resizing columns or resource-area
    for syncing heights, is row-height off-by-one because inner heights don't include border?
    when DnD fits multiple tiers of events on one resource and expands height, there's a flicker
      TODO: prevent multiple passes of height-watching?
  list-view
    for left-and-right, don't use floating, use flexbox
  hit-system
    only query DOM element for handlers like dayClick at very end
  web-component
    remove `shadow` attribute
  dev cleanliness
    remove unused css mixins
  revisit these tickets
    "Maximum update depth exceeded" error after resizing many times in Chrome --- reemerged?
      https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/issues/5606
  write tests
    percentage-based resource-timeline spreadsheet-column resizing

CHANGELOG
  temporary
    the space to accommodate scrollbars is just blank
  daygrid
    how height:'auto' isn't as squished... will always try to maintain at least aspectRatio
  exports
    DayTable no longer exposed from '@fullcalendar/daygrid/internal'
    DayGridView ('@fullcalendar/daygrid/internal') renamed to DayGridView
    DayTimeCols no longer exposed from '@fullcalendar/timegrid/internal'
    DayTimeColsView ('@fullcalendar/timegrid/internal') renamed to TimeGridView
  events & a11y
    Now each event element has stable position in time based on start-date
      in effect: strictOrder affects positioning but does not affect DOM order
  minimum browser support
    supports ?? operator -- we do this a bunch now
  updateSize deprecation
    and windowResize event is no longer fired
  tickets closed
    unnecessary scrollbars
      https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/issues/6047
  tickets to implement
    fix those 2 incorrect date-yielding results
