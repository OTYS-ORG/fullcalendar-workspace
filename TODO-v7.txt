audit all CSS
  no more event <a> tags when not a link
  rethink .fcnew-cell/fcnew-daygrid-cell classNames
  change names to runon, like "fcnew-nowindicator" and "morelink" and "viewharness"
    or "view-outer"?
  disable sticky when media:print?
  we shouldn't have 'fcnew-slot-sat' ... it's a day! instead 'fcnew-day-sat'
  ensure navlink <a> tags in headers (daygrid/timeline) are styled correctly
  did themeSystem:false ever clear the theme?
  search for all aria-* tags
  in bootstrap themes, event-height line-height is very tall. normalize? then make changelog entry?
  in timegrid, background events are incorrectly covering foreground events (background-events.html)
  test horizontal scroll normalization (for isRTL) in variety of browsers
  eventually redo list-view (and find tickets -- better <a> tag wrapper. better stickiness)
    and redo empty-list message
  AFTER: audit all locales' allDayText. there's no more max-width in the CSS. use allDayHtml with breaks if needed
  look for places where fcnew-fill* should be used
  test week numbers
  ensure outputted CSS doesn't have multiple :root declarations because of how we shifted vars.css around
  changelog: list-view defaults to stickyHeaderDates:'auto' (usually none) like it should have
  RETHINK lane names:
    'fcnew-timeline-lane', // is this the best name?
    // TODO: have lane classNames like 'fcnew-timegrid-lane'/'fcnew-timegrid-slot-lane'/'fcnew-timegrid-slat-lane'
  rething -main vs -body naming

correct header/body containers
  make daycol-header-thing a 'fcnew-daygrid-header' container!
hard to style daygrid header cells
  revive fcnew-daygrid-colheader ?
  will be mutually exclusive with fcnew-daygrid-cell
  (use this technique on datagrid too?)
  (these selectors aren't used for styling anymore! right?)
audit z-indexes
  for example, fcnew-timeline-bg seems above slats
tests aleady have fcnew- className prefix!?... actually some have .fc
restore .fc prefix
verify timeline-external-dragging.html works

FOR beta.1
  timeline
    test that +more link works
  resource-timeline
    when switching back and forth from 1-day to 3-day, many times, scrolltime gets messed up
  multimonth
    multiweek-view.html: when dragging and dropping event, scroll jumps down
  timegrid
    initial-scroll broken!!!
    test that +more link works
  daygrid
    +more link renders weird
  list
    test angular connector with elTag="th" (for ListViewHeaderRow)
  react/vue/angular connectors
    pause size-handling until all slots are rendered

ensure automated tests for...
  positioning of sticky headers in all views. list view sticky subheaders too
  resource-timeline indent works
  pixel # for height/contentHeight works
  correct header row heights for multi-header resource-TIMEgrid row with horizontal scrolling

AFTER beta.1
  test on touch
  css refactor
    maybe stop doing "frame" elements for measurements, and instead use just "cushion"
      how would that work for getting a scroller's "clientWidth/clientHeight"?
  restore print-mode
    ensure print-view has nothing sticky
      (wait, maybe we want it titles sticky onscreen for h-scroll daygrid/timeline)
  implement ResizeObserver fallback
  just like scrollbar dead area should have grey bg, make timegrid bottom area w/o slots a grey bg
  initial-scroll for views with complex rendering is wrong
    multiweek (uses DayGridLayout/dayGridYear-view), (and multimonth too?)
  daygrid
    for event rendering, expose an isStandin flag for if hidden behind multiday
    multiweek bug: drag-n-drop resets scroll
    businessHours in month view, right side, has weird 1px gap
      (happens because percentage left/width -- try to return to using 'right'?)
  timegrid
    use pixel positioning for events (to avoid TimeGridCol height hack)
    in TimeGridLayoutNormal, not nice how axis text isn't selectable
      (related to how now-indicator is rendered in axis)
  timeline
    previously, Timeline's hit system would always return slat left/right, not snap. matters?
  resource-timeline
    resource-row dom-structure unnecessarily complex
    bug: resizing two-column causes datagrid bottom padding to collapse to 1px !?
      because bottom scrollbars widths don't notify update because the inner-box doesn't change
        (ResizeObserver needs to support box:border-box)
      RELATED BUG: when bottom-padding of spreadsheet DOES work, it's off by one because querying
        for scrollbar width is faulty due to offsetWidth/clientWidth bug including border
    needed?- ability to freeze resizing while resizing columns or resource-area
    get grouping via row and col simultaneously working. should be possible. see timeline-row-n-col-grouping-not-working.html
    for syncing heights, is row-height off-by-one because inner heights don't include border?
      why not just make all column-widths done with content-box?
    change how column-resizing widths is distibuted?
      right now it's impossible to resize last column
      try to take width away from next column when expanding
  list-view
    for left-and-right, don't use floating, use flexbox
  hit-system
    only query DOM element for handlers like dayClick at very end
  web-component
    remove `shadow` attribute
  dev cleanliness
    remove unused css mixins
  revisit these tickets
    "Maximum update depth exceeded" error after resizing many times in Chrome --- reemerged?
      https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/issues/5606
    is text-selection disabled everywhere? was it before? (if fixed, find ticket)
  optimizations
    this.detachInnerHeight() // should fire a 'null' height? yes! will cleanup any map listeners
  write tests
    percentage-based resource-timeline spreadsheet-column resizing
    that expandRows works enabled/disabled for timegrid/resource-timeline views

CHANGELOG
  temporary
    the space to accommodate scrollbars is just blank
    print mode lacking
  daygrid
    how height:'auto' isn't as squished... will always try to maintain at least aspectRatio
  exports
    DayTable no longer exposed from '@fullcalendar/daygrid/internal'
    DayGridView ('@fullcalendar/daygrid/internal') renamed to DayGridView
    DayTimeCols no longer exposed from '@fullcalendar/timegrid/internal'
    DayTimeColsView ('@fullcalendar/timegrid/internal') renamed to TimeGridView
  events & a11y
    Now each event element has stable position in time based on start-date
      in effect: strictOrder affects positioning but does not affect DOM order
  minimum browser support
    supports ?? operator -- we do this a bunch now
  updateSize deprecation
    and windowResize event is no longer fired
  tickets
    unnecessary scrollbars
      https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/issues/6047
    ticket where timegrid time-axis isn't selectable
    fix those 2 incorrect date-yielding results
    make ticket where resource-timline super-header stays fixed during horizontal scrolling of datagrid
    sticky subheader of listview, don't have bottom border. ticket?
