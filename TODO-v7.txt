FOR beta.1
  stickyness!!!!! (fcnew-v-sticky/fcnew-sticky)
    remove StickyScrolling class?
  scroll-handling initializing. rethink
    (because I ripped out hacks from DayGridLayout)
  drag-n-drop
    get working!
    test external drag-n-drop
  test for ALL views
    height:auto
      and sticky footer scrollbars (daygrid/timegrid/timeline/resource-timeline)
    theming
      i can write table-inspired css utils however i want, with borders
  daygrid
    dayGridYear - test starts at correct initial day
    disabled-cell styling on monthview is broken
    with horizontal scrolling (dayMinWidth),
      header doesn't have top border
    test how month view balances week heights
    test no "final squished row"
      https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/issues/7162
  timegrid
    test hiding all-day slot (for pannable layout too)
  timeline
    slight slat misalignment with header cells when header cells are half as frequent
      (recreated in resource timeline.. in regular timeline too?)
  resource-timeline
    indent for timeline-column-grouping.html is wrong (related to GroupCells accidentally requiring it)
    need margin below events
    setting where events fill entire height of row
    test whether the "super" header cells obeys the minimum indent
    test multiple header rows, all combos
    test business hours per resource VS whole
    test rows expanding to fill height (but not groups)
      ensure no awkward behavior when contracting parent-resources
  list-view
    for left-and-right, don't use floating, use flexbox
  multi-month
    ensure initially scrolls to current day (did i abuse handleScrollRequest?)
  react/vue/angular connectors
    pause size-handling until all slots are rendered

ensure automated tests for...
  XXX

  hit-system
    only query DOM element for handlers like dayClick at very end
  web-component
    remove `shadow` attribute
  dev cleanliness
    remove unused css mixins
  revisit these tickets
    "Maximum update depth exceeded" error after resizing many times in Chrome --- reemerged?
      https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/issues/5606
