audit all CSS
  no more event <a> tags when not a link
  rethink .fc-cell/fc-daygrid-cell classNames
  change names to runon, like "fc-nowindicator" and "morelink" and "viewharness"
    or "view-outer"?
  disable sticky when media:print?
  we shouldn't have 'fc-slot-sat' ... it's a day! instead 'fc-day-sat'
  ensure navlink <a> tags in headers (daygrid/timeline) are styled correctly
  did themeSystem:false ever clear the theme?
  search for all aria-* tags
  in bootstrap themes, event-height line-height is very tall. normalize? then make changelog entry?
  in timegrid, background events are incorrectly covering foreground events (background-events.html)
  test horizontal scroll normalization (for isRTL) in variety of browsers
  eventually redo list-view (and find tickets -- better <a> tag wrapper. better stickiness)
    and redo empty-list message
  AFTER: audit all locales' allDayText. there's no more max-width in the CSS. use allDayHtml with breaks if needed
  look for places where fc-fill* should be used
  test week numbers
  ensure outputted CSS doesn't have multiple :root declarations because of how we shifted vars.css around
  changelog: list-view defaults to stickyHeaderDates:'auto' (usually none) like it should have
  RETHINK lane names:
    'fc-timeline-lane', // is this the best name?
    // TODO: have lane classNames like 'fc-timegrid-lane'/'fc-timegrid-slot-lane'/'fc-timegrid-slat-lane'
  rething -main vs -body naming
  remove -view from view classNames? looks nice!
  view should have classNames like fc-resource-timegrid AND fc-timegrid
  solve z-index:9999 hacks. audit all z-indexes
  fc-daygrid-cell-number is an awkward classname... fc-daygrid-day-number instead? fc-daygrid-datenumber/daynumber?
  the testing "wrappers" like DayGridWrapper should us aria tags to find rows/cells
  test license warning message
  in datagrid, move fc-resource to the fc-row (instead of each fc-cell)... add to changelog
    will need to change tests after
  inconsistent abbrev of 'col' like 'fc-timegrid-col'
  .fc-cell-main doesn't need to be span anymore (within a flex parent)
  .fc-timeline-now-indicator-container covers all the text in the header cells
  events in timeline-no-overlap.html are too thick now?
  changelog: what used to be <th> cells are no longer bold (except for list view)
  why does TimelineLane::render get called 3 times initially?
  file bug for timeline event dragging:
    1. have +more link with eventMaxStack
    2. open link, begin to drag event
    3. event looses it's duration. inconsistent with how normal event dragging happens
  daygrid event "reslicing" disabled to prevent compact daygrid bug (in multimonth) --- `allowReslicing`
    TODO: thing hard about whether to keep this
    if removing, can probably optimize and avoid getSegStartId/getSegSpanId
  performance improvement:
    if event will never be rendered because >eventMaxStack or >dayMaxEvents, don't put in dom at all!
  in timegrid (and other views), when rendering +more link, ensure it's in the correct DOM order
    right now, all hidden +more links are put at beginning
  position the popover -1px -1px, to overlap border
  scroll issues
    resource-timeline
      when switching back and forth from 1-day to 3-day, many times, scrolltime gets messed up
        related to slots growing in size!
    multimonth
      multiweek-view.html: when dragging and dropping event, scroll jumps down
    daygrid
      multiweek 'today' doesn't scroll into view
  audit flickering during react custom rendering
  angular not compiling with our Preact version
    https://github.com/preactjs/preact/issues/4023
    tried skipLibCheck:true, but getting runtime errors (related!?). reverted
  responsive: make ticket where popover is responsive?
  for header cells, all of which are flex-columns with aligned inner content, somehow to overflow:hidden?
    right now, if sized really narrow, text bleeds out. in conflict with stickiness? way around?
  multimonth responsive BUG:
    1. start out in different view, size window really small
    2. switch to multimonth, size window large
    3. multi-columns don't appear. just one column with vertically-squished months

FOR beta.1
  ALL
    implement scroller padding rectangles
    go back to simple classNames for views

ensure automated tests for...
  positioning of sticky headers in all views. list view sticky subheaders too
  resource-timeline indent works
  pixel # for height/contentHeight works
  correct header row heights for multi-header resource-TIMEgrid row with horizontal scrolling

AFTER beta.1
  test on touch
  css refactor
    maybe stop doing "frame" elements for measurements, and instead use just "cushion"
      how would that work for getting a scroller's "clientWidth/clientHeight"?
    research every possible event overflow scenario when events don't have much space
  restore print-mode
    ensure print-view has nothing sticky
      (wait, maybe we want it titles sticky onscreen for h-scroll daygrid/timeline)
  implement ResizeObserver fallback
  just like scrollbar dead area should have grey bg, make timegrid bottom area w/o slots a grey bg
  initial-scroll for views with complex rendering is wrong
    multiweek (uses DayGridLayout/dayGridYear-view), (and multimonth too?)
  daygrid
    for event rendering, expose an isStandin flag for if hidden behind multiday
    multiweek bug: drag-n-drop resets scroll
    businessHours in month view, right side, has weird 1px gap
      (happens because percentage left/width -- try to return to using 'right'?)
  timegrid
    use pixel positioning for events (to avoid TimeGridCol height hack)
    in TimeGridLayoutNormal, not nice how axis text isn't selectable
      (related to how now-indicator is rendered in axis)
  timeline
    previously, Timeline's hit system would always return slat left/right, not snap. matters?
  resource-timeline
    resource-row dom-structure unnecessarily complex
    bug: resizing two-column causes datagrid bottom padding to collapse to 1px !?
      because bottom scrollbars widths don't notify update because the inner-box doesn't change
        (ResizeObserver needs to support box:border-box)
      RELATED BUG: when bottom-padding of spreadsheet DOES work, it's off by one because querying
        for scrollbar width is faulty due to offsetWidth/clientWidth bug including border
    needed?- ability to freeze resizing while resizing columns or resource-area
    get grouping via row and col simultaneously working. should be possible. see timeline-row-n-col-grouping-not-working.html
    for syncing heights, is row-height off-by-one because inner heights don't include border?
      why not just make all column-widths done with content-box?
    change how column-resizing widths is distibuted?
      right now it's impossible to resize last column
      try to take width away from next column when expanding
  list-view
    for left-and-right, don't use floating, use flexbox
  hit-system
    only query DOM element for handlers like dayClick at very end
  web-component
    remove `shadow` attribute
  dev cleanliness
    remove unused css mixins
  revisit these tickets
    "Maximum update depth exceeded" error after resizing many times in Chrome --- reemerged?
      https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/issues/5606
    is text-selection disabled everywhere? was it before? (if fixed, find ticket)
  optimizations
    this.detachInnerHeight() // should fire a 'null' height? yes! will cleanup any map listeners
  write tests
    percentage-based resource-timeline spreadsheet-column resizing
    that expandRows works enabled/disabled for timegrid/resource-timeline views

CHANGELOG
  temporary
    angular broken because of Preact version
    the space to accommodate scrollbars is just blank
    print mode lacking
  daygrid
    how height:'auto' isn't as squished... will always try to maintain at least aspectRatio
  exports
    DayTable no longer exposed from '@fullcalendar/daygrid/internal'
    DayGridView ('@fullcalendar/daygrid/internal') renamed to DayGridView
    DayTimeCols no longer exposed from '@fullcalendar/timegrid/internal'
    DayTimeColsView ('@fullcalendar/timegrid/internal') renamed to TimeGridView
  events & a11y
    Now each event element has stable position in time based on start-date
      in effect: strictOrder affects positioning but does not affect DOM order
  minimum browser support
    supports ?? operator -- we do this a bunch now
  updateSize deprecation
    and windowResize event is no longer fired
  tickets
    unnecessary scrollbars

    fix those 2 incorrect date-yielding results
    make ticket where resource-timline super-header stays fixed during horizontal scrolling of datagrid
    sticky subheader of listview, don't have bottom border. ticket?
