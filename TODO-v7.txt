FOR beta.1
  test for ALL views
    height:auto
      and sticky footer scrollbars (daygrid/timegrid/timeline/resource-timeline)
    stickyHeaderDates
      non-pannable timegrid doesn't work because header+all-day-section have tight parent
    stickyFooterScrollbars
    axis as top left (timegrid w/ hscroll, resource-timeline) doesn't have correct v-centering
    RTL
    redo cell borders
      we have major/minor mixed up
      should we always assume solid border style?
      TEST: with horizontal scrolling (dayMinWidth),
        header doesn't have top border
      theming
        i can write table-inspired css utils however i want, with borders
  daygrid
    test how month view balances week heights
    test no "final squished row"
      https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/issues/7162
    multiweek
      drag-n-drop resets scroll
  timegrid
    need margin below events in ALL-DAY section
    need RIGHT margin for timed events
    test hiding all-day slot (for pannable layout too)
  timeline
    need bottom margins *between* events
    slight slat misalignment with header cells when header cells are half as frequent
      (recreated in resource timeline.. in regular timeline too?)
  resource-timeline
    there's a double-border at bottom of datagrid
    indent for timeline-column-grouping.html is wrong (related to GroupCells accidentally requiring it)
    setting where events fill entire height of row
    test sticky GroupCell content (vertically sticky)
    test whether the "super" header cells obeys the minimum indent
    test multiple header rows, all combos
    test business hours per resource VS whole
    test rows expanding to fill height (but not groups)
      ensure no awkward behavior when contracting parent-resources
    for syncing heights, is row-height off-by-one because inner heights don't include border?
    when DnD fits multiple tiers of events on one resource and expands height, there's a flicker
      TODO: prevent multiple passes of height-watching?
  list-view
    for left-and-right, don't use floating, use flexbox
  multi-month
    ensure initially scrolls to current day (did i abuse handleScrollRequest?)
  react/vue/angular connectors
    pause size-handling until all slots are rendered

ensure automated tests for...
  XXX

AFTER beta.1
  restore print-mode
  implement ResizeObserver fallback
  initial-scroll for views with complex rendering is wrong
    multiweek (uses DayGridLayout/dayGridYear-view), (maybe multimonth too)
  daygrid
    for event rendering, expose an isStandin flag for if hidden behind multiday
  timeline
    previously, Timeline's hit system would always return slat left/right, not snap. matters?
  resource-timeline
    needed?- ability to freeze resizing while resizing columns or resource-area
  hit-system
    only query DOM element for handlers like dayClick at very end
  web-component
    remove `shadow` attribute
  dev cleanliness
    remove unused css mixins
  revisit these tickets
    "Maximum update depth exceeded" error after resizing many times in Chrome --- reemerged?
      https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/issues/5606
  write tests
    percentage-based resource-timeline spreadsheet-column resizing

CHANGELOG
  temporary
    the space to accommodate scrollbars is just blank
  daygrid
    how height:'auto' isn't as squished... will always try to maintain at least aspectRatio
  exports
    DayTable no longer exposed from '@fullcalendar/daygrid/internal'
    DayGridView ('@fullcalendar/daygrid/internal') renamed to DayGridView
    DayTimeCols no longer exposed from '@fullcalendar/timegrid/internal'
    DayTimeColsView ('@fullcalendar/timegrid/internal') renamed to TimeGridView
  events & a11y
    Now each event element has stable position in time based on start-date
      in effect: strictOrder affects positioning but does not affect DOM order
  minimum browser support
    supports ?? operator -- we do this a bunch now
  updateSize deprecation
    and windowResize event is no longer fired
